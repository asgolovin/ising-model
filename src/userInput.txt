Hi, welcome to the Ising simulation! The Ising model is a simple model of a ferromagnet used in
solid state physics. It consists of binary magnets - we will call them spins - on a 2D lattice. 

A single spin can point either up (+1) or down (-1). If an external magnetic field is present, 
the spin wants to line up with the field.

Furthermore, each spin interacts with its neighbors. This interaction is described by 
the coupling constant J. If J is larger than 0, neighboring spins try to point in the same 
direction and produce a magnetic field on their own. 
Such materials are called ferromagnetic. The magnets on your fridge are exactly that!

If J is smaller than 0, neighboring spins prefer to point in opposite directions and their 
magnetic fields cancel each other out. 
Such materials are called antiferromagnetic.
 
That's all there is to it! The Ising model is quite simple, but very powerful. If you want 
to learn more, the Wikipedia article is very comprehensive:

Let's start! Please enter the size of the lattice (10-500)
@
Now set the coupling constant J in the range from -1 to +1.
J > 0: ferromagnet
J < 0: antiferromagnet
@
Enter the external magnetic field B in the range from -10 to +10.
Leave it at 0 to see how a ferromagnet forms even in the absence of an external magnetic field.
@
Finally, enter the temperature. High temperature brings chaos into the system, which means that
the spins will not order themselves even if the coupling constant is positive. 
If we slowly decrease the temperature, order will overcome chaos at some point and the material
will become ferromagnetic. 
This is called a phase transition. 

If J = +1 and B = 0, the phase transition should happen at T = 2.26K. Try entering values above 
and below this point!

Select the simulation algorithm: single cluster (enter c) or heatbath (enter h). Single cluster 
gives precise measurements very fast, but the heatbath looks nice.

Excelent! Starting the simulation...
